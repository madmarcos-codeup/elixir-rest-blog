add the ViewController.java back into their projects

no longer use intellij to test the app. just go to http://localhost:8080 or 8081
	also redirects now from changing address line in the browser



change User.java annotations on Role and Posts

public class User {

    public enum Role {USER, ADMIN};

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;
    @NotEmpty
    @Email
    private String email;
    private String username;
    @JsonIgnore
    @ToString.Exclude
    private String password;
    @NotNull
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Role role;
    @JsonIgnore
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE, orphanRemoval = true)
    @ToString.Exclude
    private Collection<Post> posts;

}


change data type for users.role in db to CHAR(10) and make sure values are in there
	GO AHEAD AND DELETE ALL USERS AND ALL POSTS

make sure password field in users table is VARCHAR(255)

IMPORTANT passwords may need to be stored in the db encrypted
	SO REGISTER A USER FIRST!!!! so the password gets encrypted
